# Matomo IgnoreDNTByDefault Plugin

## Description

Before 3.9.0 Matomo ignored the DoNotTrack setting in Internet Explorer, Maxthon and Epiphany as these browsers have enabled it by default without any interaction by users.

If a significant fraction of your website vistors use these browsers and are missing in your reports because of this change, you can install this plugin to restore the old behaviour.
